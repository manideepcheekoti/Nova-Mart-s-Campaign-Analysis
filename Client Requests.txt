 The operations team wants to ensure the integrity of the events data by removing
 duplicates. Check for and remove duplicate rows in the events dataframe based
 on store_id, campaign_id, and product_code. How many duplicate rows were
 removed?
 2. Howmany cities have more than 5 stores?
 3. The sales team has identified missing values in the quantity_sold(before_promo)
 data. Estimate these values using the median quantity sold before the promotion.
 How many missing values were filled, and what is the median used for
 imputation?
 4. Identify the product category with the lowest base price before the promotion.
 5. What is the total quantity sold after the promotion for the BOGOF promo type
 during the Diwali campaign?
 6. Which store recorded the highest quantity sold after the promotion during the
 Diwali campaign?
 7. Understand which campaigns had the most successful outcomes. Compare the
 total quantities sold before and after the promotions for the Sankranti and Diwali
 campaigns. Which campaign saw a greater increase in sales?
 8. Which product recorded the highest Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%)
 during the Sankranti campaign? What is the IR% for this product?
 9. Which store in Visakhapatnam recorded the lowest Incremental Sold Units
 Percentage (ISU%) during the Diwali campaign? What is the ISU% for that
 store?
 10.Which promo type had both a negative Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%)
 and Incremental Sold Units Percentage (ISU%) during the Sankranti campaign?





 Create visuals and provide insights for the requested business questions below.
 1. Visualize the number of stores in each city. Identify the city with the most stores
 and explain the distribution of stores across other cities. How does the number of
 stores in Bengaluru compare with those in Hyderabad and Chennai?
 (Hint: Use a bar chart to visualize the number of stores by city)
 2. Analyze the total quantity sold after promotion for the Sankranti campaign across
 different product categories. What percentage does each category contribute to
 the overall sales, and what insights can be drawn from these contributions?
 (Hint: Use a pie chart to visualize percentage contribution of each category to the overall sales)
 3. Examine the correlation between base price (after the promotion) and sales
 quantities (after the promotion). What insights can be drawn regarding the
 relationship between base price and sales quantities after the promotion?
 (Hint: Use heatmap to get the correlation)
 4. Analyze the distribution of quantity sold before the promotion for each product
 category (Grocery & Staples, Home Care, Personal Care, Home Appliances,
 etc.). What patterns or trends do you observe across these categories, and how
 could these insights inform future promotional strategies?
 (Hint: Use individual histograms to visualize the distribution)
 5. Analyze the incremental sold units percentage (ISU%) across various cities.
 Identify the city with the highest ISU% after the promotion and the city with the
 smallest change. What trends can be observed about the effectiveness of promotions in driving sales across these cities?
 (Hint: Use a line chart to visualize the ISU% comparison across cities)
 6. Analyze the relationship between incremental revenue and incremental sold units
 for different promotion types in Hyderabad. Which promotion type led to the
 highest incremental sold units, and which one generated the highest incremental
 revenue? What insights can you draw from the balance between the two metrics
 for this city?
 (Hint: Use a scatter plot to analyze the relationship)
 7. Analyze the revenue before and after promotions across different product
 categories in Bengaluru. What trends can be identified in the performance of
 each category, and how did promotions impact overall revenue in the city?
 (Hint: Use a vertical bar chart to compare the revenue before and after promotions)
 Key Metrics:
 ● IR%(Incremental Revenue): IR% measures the percentage change in revenue
 after a promotion compared to the revenue before the promotion. It helps assess
 how effective a promotion was in driving revenue growth.
 ● ISU%(Incremental Sold Units): ISU% calculates the percentage change in the
 number of units sold after a promotion compared to the units sold before the
 promotion. It indicates the effectiveness of a promotion in boosting sales volume.
